OpenGL doesn't simply transform all your 3D coordinates to 2D pixels on your screen; 
OpenGL only processes 3D coordinates when they're in a specific range between -1.0 and 1.0 on all 3 axes (x, y and z). 
All coordinates within this so called normalized device coordinates range will end up visible on your screen
